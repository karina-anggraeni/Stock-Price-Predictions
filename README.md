This project serves as the final and ultimate exam for Purwadhika Data Science and Machine Learning course I have been taking for the past 5 months. I have an interest in stock markets and pricing, that is why I decided to choose this topic. Even though far from perfect, I hope this project can be a stepping stone for me to learn more about data science algorithms in the future.

I am using stock historical data for 6 different banks that I choose from 3 categories. Those are national private bank (BBCA and MEGA), state-owned public bank (BBRI and BMRI) and foreign private bank (SDRA and BNII).
